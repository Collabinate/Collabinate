# Collabinate

Collaborative and social technologies have evolved from a consumer novelty to become a software necessity.  Enterprise systems are increasingly incorporating social sharing, microblogging, and activity feed functionality.  Until now, this has required either conforming and contorting to accomodate an existing "framework", or developing the needed features from scratch.

Collabinate aims to provide simple, modular functionality to any level needed so that you can add high performance collaboration, microblogging, and activity feed features to your existing applications with minimal effort.
